	abstract = {Recent scholarship has focused extensively on the rise of diverse neighborhoods in U.S. cities. Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks we have for describing residential settlement patterns generally treat diversity as an unstable and transitory period that is the product of a unidirectional pressure towards segregation. In our analysis of six diverse neighborhoods in Southeast Seattle, we find evidence of processes at multiple scales that not only maintain diversity, but actually reinforce it. From individual decisions about property ownership to broader patterns of regional disinvestment, we find empirical evidence that indicates a need for a more complex theorization of the processes that create and sustain diverse neighborhoods. In our preliminary theorization of these conditions, we call for a conceptualization of residential settlement patterns that is explicitly multiscalar and recognizes a wider range of cultural, economic, and political relations as central to the production of observed patterns of neighborhood settlement.},

	abstract = {Successful integration of newly arriving refugees requires the engagement of the receiving community and active facilitation of integration through provision of employment, access to housing, and protection of basic rights. Understanding how local entities effectively facilitate integration is important for policymakers and scholars interested in identifying best practices and replicating outcomes. This study examines the integration outcomes of refugees who participated in a vocational hospitality training program in Chicago, Illinois between 2008 and 2012. In particular, we explore the integration experiences—using employment, housing, and homeownership—of Bhutanese origin refugees who represented the largest country of origin group in the hospitality course. We find that the Bhutanese refugees who participated in the course had high rates of homeownership, stable employment, higher wages and experienced socioeconomic upward mobility—positive indicators of integration. In our analysis, we identify three reasons the program is successful in facilitating integration: a practice of selective enrollment, active employer engagement, and informed industry selection. Importantly, our findings suggest a positive benefit for employers in addition to refugee employees.},

            Refugees resettled through the United States Refugee Admissions Program are expected to become economically self-sufficient by 90 days post arrival. To meet this expectation, refugee resettlement agencies attempt to place refugees in employment as rapidly as possible. Consequently, refugees are placed into pre-identified jobs—termed survival jobs—at partner employers in the secondary labour market largely irrespective of career background. This study examines the long-term employment and socio-economic outcomes of refugees given the agency approach and resulting initial job placement. To do so, I use individual employment records from a refugee resettlement agency in Chicago, semi-structured interviews with refugees and autoethnography conducted over an eight-year period (2008–16). I find that the initial employment placements made by the refugee resettlement agency in the immediate period post-arrival have long-term implications for economic integration. Refugees in general, but in particular those who arrive with less relevant human capital, remain in employment at agency partners five years after arrival. These positions offer limited opportunities for upward economic mobility, leaving many refugees at or near the Federal Poverty Line.},
